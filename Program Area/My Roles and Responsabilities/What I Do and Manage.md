I work for Seven Mountains EMS Council, an EMS Council in Central Pennsylvania that covers 9 counties, about 90 services. I do not work on an ambulance, I am an administrative regional Support staff. I do have a history of truck time, but that is not my current work, and as long as I maintain my job, I do not plan on that changing. At the Council I am considered an EMS Program Specialist, my focus at the Council is on several aspects of the Council, I am the Quality Assurance Lead which puts me lead of Regional Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) which is managing and working with the Agency Medical Directors as well as the Regional Medical Director. I also handle Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) being the staff lead of the committee for that as well. Complaints and Investigations have gotten lumped into my job which is not really the best, but I deal with it. Pennsylvanian has laws surrounding this which adds to the complexity. I have just recently been given the reins of Licensure, which actually is well suited in my office. I manage some preparedness tasks. Additionally, I am the Pennsylvanian CARES Coordinator. Each of these roles have their own tasks and workflows, some of them sort of overlap, but for the most part they are all independent of each other. My job is challenging because there are a lot of rules and regulations that I need to follow and if I do not, there would be issues. Knowing the rules and regulations is a challenge in itself.
