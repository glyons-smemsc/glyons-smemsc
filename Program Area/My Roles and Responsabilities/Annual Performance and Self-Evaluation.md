# Annual Performance Self-Evaluation

**Employee:** [Your Name]

**Position:** EMS Program Specialist / QA Lead

**Review Period:** [Year]

### 1. Key Accomplishments & Contributions

-   **Regulatory Oversight & Licensure:** Successfully transitioned into the Lead for Regional Licensure. I have standardized the inspection process for our 90 agencies, ensuring that every vehicle and service in our 9-county footprint meets **Title 28** requirements before arriving at a scene.
    
-   **Clinical Leadership (MAC/CQI):** Facilitated high-level collaboration between the Regional Medical Director and Agency Medical Directors. Under my leadership, the CQI committee has moved toward a more data-driven approach, using regional trends to inform clinical education rather than just reacting to individual errors.
    
-   **PA CARES Excellence:** As the Regional Coordinator, I have maintained a high rate of data compliance across the region. This work directly allows us to measure "Survival to Discharge" rates, providing the only true metric of our system's life-saving efficacy.
    
-   **Investigative Integrity:** Managed complex complaints and investigations with strict adherence to Pennsylvania law. I have prioritized impartiality and thorough documentation to protect the Council and the public, despite the inherent challenges of this task.
    

### 2. Areas of Growth & Challenge

-   **Regulatory Complexity:** The primary challenge this year has been the evolving landscape of PA EMS regulations. Navigating the nuances of **Act 37** requires constant study. I am committed to becoming the "subject matter expert" so that agencies can look to our office for definitive answers.
    
-   **Workload Balance:** Balancing the "fixed" deadlines of licensure with the "unpredictable" nature of investigations and complaints is an ongoing priority. I am refining my workflow to ensure neither pillar of my job suffers during peak inspection seasons.
    

### 3. Goals for the Next Review Period

-   **Process Automation:** To explore digital tracking for licensure and investigation timelines to ensure no regulatory deadlines are missed.
    
-   **Regional Education:** To host a "State of the Region" QA session for Agency Medical Directors, sharing the high-level CARES and CQI data we’ve collected to drive clinical improvement.
    
-   **Professional Certification:** To identify and attend advanced training specifically for regulatory investigators or healthcare quality professionals.

# Resources to Enhance Your Performance

Since your job is a blend of **Law, Medicine, and Administration**, "bettering your performance" usually means increasing your efficiency in managing data and people.

### 1. Specialized Training (The "Hard" Skills)

-   **NAEMSO Resources:** The _National Association of EMS Officials_ has specific resources for people in state/regional roles. Their "EMS Education" or "Regulatory" tracks are built exactly for your job description.
    
-   **Investigative Interviewing:** Since you handle complaints, a short course in "Forensic/Investigative Interviewing" (often used by HR or Law Enforcement) can help you navigate difficult conversations with providers without it becoming adversarial.
    
-   **Lean Six Sigma (White or Yellow Belt):** This is a methodology for "process improvement." It is highly valued in QA/CQI roles because it gives you a framework for fixing systemic errors in the 90 agencies you oversee.
    

### 2. Efficiency Tools (The "Soft" Skills)

-   **Project Management Software:** If you aren't using one, a tool like **Trello** or **Asana** can help you track the 90 different licensure statuses and ongoing investigations simultaneously.
    
-   **Data Visualization:** Since you manage CARES and CQI data, learning basic **PowerBI** or advanced **Excel** (Pivot Tables/Charts) will allow you to present data to the MAC in a way that is visually "punchy" and easy for doctors to digest quickly.
    

### 3. Regulatory "Deep Dives"

-   **Legislative Tracking:** Set up alerts for the **Pennsylvania Bulletin**. This is where changes to Title 28 and EMS scope of practice are officially published. Being the first to know about a change makes you an indispensable resource to your 90 agencies.
