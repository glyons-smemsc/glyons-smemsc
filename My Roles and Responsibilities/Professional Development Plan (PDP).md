# Professional Development Plan (PDP): 2026-2027

**Employee:** [Your Name]

**Position:** EMS Program Specialist / QA Lead

**Objective:** To enhance regional oversight capabilities through advanced certification in regulatory investigation, clinical data analytics, and healthcare quality management.

***

## Focus Area 1: Regulatory Investigation & Enforcement

**The Goal:** To formalize the "Complaints & Investigations" process to ensure 100% compliance with PA Act 37 and minimize legal exposure for the Council.

-   **Proposed Training:** **CLEAR (Council on Licensure, Enforcement and Regulation)** – _National Certified Investigator/Inspector Training (NCIT)._
    
-   **Why it helps the Council:** This provides a standardized, legally defensible framework for conducting interviews and gathering evidence. It ensures that when we handle a complaint, it is "bulletproof" if challenged in court or by the Bureau.
    
-   **Timeline:** Q3 2026.
    

## Focus Area 2: Advanced Clinical Quality Improvement (CQI)

**The Goal:** To move beyond simple data collection and begin "Predictive Analytics" for our 90 agencies.

-   **Proposed Training:** **CPHQ (Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality)** or **NAEMSO Quality Improvement Course.**
    
-   **Why it helps the Council:** As the lead for MAC and CQI, having a national-level certification in quality ensures that Seven Mountains is using the most modern methodologies to improve patient outcomes. This directly impacts our CARES data and survival rates.
    
-   **Target Tool:** Mastery of **PowerBI** or **Tableau** for ePCR data visualization.
    

## Focus Area 3: Operational Efficiency & Licensure

**The Goal:** To streamline the licensure process for 90 agencies to reduce administrative "friction" and manual errors.

-   **Proposed Training:** **Lean Six Sigma (Yellow Belt).**
    
-   **Why it helps the Council:** Six Sigma is about removing waste from a process. By applying this to our Licensure and Inspection workflow, we can reduce the "man-hours" required per agency inspection, allowing me to focus more on high-level preparedness and MAC coordination.
    
-   **Timeline:** Q4 2026.

## Executive Summary of Value

"By investing in these specific areas, I will transition from managing these programs to **optimizing** them. As the regulatory landscape in Pennsylvania becomes more complex, having a staff member with certified expertise in investigation and quality improvement protects the Council’s interests and ensures that our 90 agencies receive the highest level of professional support."

### How to use this:

1.  **The "Pre-Meeting":** Mention to your boss that you’ve been thinking about how to make the "Complaints/Investigations" side of your job more efficient and defensible.
    
2.  **The Presentation:** Hand them this document. It shows you aren't just asking for a "class"—you are asking for tools to solve the Council's problems.
    
3.  **The Budget:** If they say there is no budget, ask if you can at least have 2 hours of "Administrative Leave" per week to pursue the free/low-cost versions of these trainings (like the Data Analytics or state-sponsored webinars).
